\header{My Research in Three Sentences}
I design algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems.
My Ph.D. focused on  approximation algorithms for classic theory questions (particularly, in scheduling). 
In my post-doctoral work, I work broadly in beyond-worst-case analysis.
% though I am most interested in developing theoretical foundations for learning-augmented algorithms.
