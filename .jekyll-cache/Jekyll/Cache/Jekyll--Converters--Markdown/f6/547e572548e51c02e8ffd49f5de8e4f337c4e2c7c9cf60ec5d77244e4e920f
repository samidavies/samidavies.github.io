<p>A lot of people are skeptical of yoga, and the stigma associated with it is unfortunately well deserved. The showing off on Instagram, the cultural appropriation… there are several issues with the way in which yoga has been popularized. If these things about yoga annoy you, that’s ok.
Despite this, everyone can benefit from yoga by building a practice which suits their needs;
whether that’s health, exercise, meditation, or relaxation.</p>

<h3 id="yoga-then-and-now">Yoga then and now</h3>

<p>Yoga was first developed around the 5th or 6th century BC and played an important role in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism . The practice focused on connecting the physical, mental, and spiritual self, but its form varied depending on the religious beliefs of the individual.</p>

<p>Throughout the 1900s, yoga teachers from India came to North America and taught people how to teach yoga. One such man was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._K._S._Iyengar">Bellur Krishnamachar Sundararaja Iyengar</a>, who was the founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iyengar_Yoga">Iyengar yoga</a> as well as the author of several books on philosophy and practicing yoga. In the 80s, yoga began to be practiced in a way that was unaffiliated with any religious denomination. Enter the early 2000s, and bam: now everyone and their mom does yoga.</p>

<p>There are several different types of yoga. The practice that suits you best depends on what you’d like to get out of it. Below is an attempt to characterize a few of the most common types of yoga in the US.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ashtanga yoga</strong> is an athletic practice which focuses on matching movement with breath. It focuses on building heat within the body, instead of relying on external heat. Ashtanga yoga literally means <a href="http://www.ashtanga.com/html/background.html">eight-limbed yoga</a>, analogous to the eight spiritual practices needed to follow the path of internal purification for revealing the Universal self. This style was also the inspiration for the next yoga style.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Power yoga</strong> or <strong>Vinyasa yoga</strong> are generic terms, and normally refer to a type of yoga which branched off from Ashtanga yoga in the 80s. Most of the yoga studios you see around the US fall under this category. Power yoga classes are typically 60-75 minutes long and are heated to around 90 <script type="math/tex">^{\circ} F</script>. Most of a Power yoga class is a medium-fast paced flow, or sequence of poses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Baptiste yoga</strong> is a branch off of Power yoga. Classes are normally heated and a bit longer, around 90 minutes. This practice is known to be a challenging workout.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bikram yoga</strong> practices perform the same breathing exercises and 26 poses each time. Studios which teach Bikram yoga are typically heated to 105 <script type="math/tex">^{\circ} F</script>, and classes last between 45-60 minutes. It is a common misconception that Bikram yoga refers to yoga performed in a hot room, but as you see there are many types of yoga performed in a heated environment.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-should-i-try-yoga">Why should I try yoga</h3>

<p>There are plenty of resources which will go into detail about the benefits of practicing yoga. This next section cites various sources, and I encourage you to check out any of the links in this section if you’d like to know more about a particular topic.</p>

<h4 id="looking-to-get-flexible">Looking to get flexible</h4>

<p>Flexibility doesn’t mean popping into a full split whenever you feel like it. Flexibility refers to the ability for your joints and body parts to execute a large range of motion. It’s essential for day to day activities like walking, bending, and lifting. That means that flexibility is important to keeping our bodies able to move in ways that we need them to.</p>

<p>Warmer muscle tissue from stretching increases the flow of nutrient rich blood to these areas, leading to better circulation and healthier joints. Healthy joints with proper circulation <a href="http://www.fitness.com/articles/660/the_importance_of_flexibility.php">degenerate slower</a>, giving you better movement for longer in your life. Your back and posture also benefit from flexibility training. Flexible hamstrings, hip flexors, and pelvic muscles lead to a healthier and stronger lower back. In addition, tissue is  realigned by stretching, which leads to better posture, and less effort to maintain better posture.</p>

<p>General exercise will also help with better circulation. However, certain types of exercise can hurt your body in other ways when not complemented with proper flexibility training. In particular, exercise involving running or weight lifting leads to joint and muscle fatigue. Flexibility will reduce muscle soreness, so that you can perform even better. Furthermore, the reduction of resistance from muscle tissue from larger ranges of motion in your joints <a href="http://www.fitness.com/articles/660/the_importance_of_flexibility.php">reduces the chance of injury</a>. Flexibility training can enhance your performance in <a href="http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/the-importance-and-purpose-of-flexibility">sports, aerobic exercises, and weight training</a></p>

<p>Any type of yoga is a healthy way to engage in flexibility training. Many studios are heated in order to aid the muscles in relaxing during poses. If you’re uncomfortable practicing in a heated environment, a similar effect can be achieved by making sure you’re properly warmed up before beginning flexibility training. Most any aerobic exercise will accomplish this.  To avoid injury, you must make sure your muscle tissue is warmed up before beginning any type of flexibility training and never push your range of motion near the point of pain.</p>

<h4 id="looking-to-destress">Looking to destress</h4>

<p>Yoga was originally much more centered around meditation than what most popularized practices are today. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/19/meditation-benefits_n_5842870.html">Meditation has a ton of benefits</a> by itself. Those that <em>The Huffington Post</em> sites include</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>increased self awareness</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>increased happiness</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>inducing relaxation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>improved concentration</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reducing stress</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>encouraging a healthy lifestyle</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Yoga is often referred to as a <em>moving meditation</em>. While the practice can be quite physical, it is first and foremost a time to let go of whatever is happening in your life and focus on the connection between your body, breath, and mind in that moment.</p>

<p>The American Osteopathic Association also cites that yoga helps people learn how to <a href="http://www.osteopathic.org/osteopathic-health/about-your-health/health-conditions-library/general-health/Pages/yoga.aspx">manage their stress</a> by creating clarity and calmness, increasing body awareness, relieving chronic stress patterns, relaxing the mind, centering attention, and sharpening concentration. Often in yoga, you’re holding a pose that is rather uncomfortable. What you’re learning in this instance is coping. Here is a situation filled with discomfort, and you’re forced to sit there and breathe through it. Imagine being able to do that with a smile on your face everyday.</p>

<h4 id="looking-for-a-workout">Looking for a workout</h4>

<p>While yoga is often associated with being relaxing and slow, it can be used as a physical workout as well. This section mainly cites <a href="http://time.com/4185626/yoga-exercise-workout/">this Time article</a>, which has its own stellar list of reputable sources.</p>

<p>Google will tell you that a 150 lb person practicing for 1 hour will burn 594 calories from Power yoga, 477 calories from Bikram yoga, and 189 calories from a more relaxed and slow paced yoga. <a href="http://time.com/2967716/you-asked-is-hot-yoga-good-for-you-and-for-weight-loss/">Another Time article</a> provides substantially lower estimates. Yoga does burn enough calories to count as moderate exercise for a day, however the exact amount really varies on the practice.</p>

<p>But don’t let the modest calorie burn fool you. Studies have shown that practicing yoga does <a href="http://time.com/4185626/yoga-exercise-workout/">result in weight loss</a>. Yoga regulates levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which in turn regulates your appetite, mood, and sleep schedule. All of these can help with weight loss, but more importantly they lead to a healthier heart and lower blood pressure. Many doctors recommend using yoga to complement other exercise and not in place of it.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, any type of yoga which has a component of flowing through poses will provide more of an aerobic workout. Styles of yoga which involve holding poses for extended periods of time will work your entire lower body, particularly glutes, quads, and hamstrings, as well as in your biceps, triceps, and shoulders if you’ll play in some arm balances. Balance is improved and the core is strengthened through all types of yoga.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.yogajournal.com/category/anatomy/">This page</a> on <em>YogaJournal</em> provides a list of poses by anatomy if there are certain areas of your body that you’d like to focus on.</p>

<p>No matter what yoga practice you pursue, the most important element is <strong>safety</strong>. Proper hydration is important before any type of exercise, but especially before a heated yoga practice. Most importantly, do what your body tells you. Pain is bad, and you should never be in pain during exercise. Specifically pain in yoga is your body telling you that you’re trying to make it do something that it’s not ready for. Numbness and tingling are also signs that some movement is not good for your body. Always modify when necessary and take breaks as you need them.</p>

<h4 id="looking-for-a-community">Looking for a community</h4>

<p>Yoga studios, climbing gyms, fitness centers, etc. are great places to meet people. Especially if you interact with the same 20 people every day, it provides a nice chance to diversify who you talk to. Yoga communities are, in most cases, super inclusive no matter what your skill level.</p>

<h3 id="getting-started-with-yoga">Getting started with yoga</h3>

<p>Tons of free videos exist online if you’d like to practice in the privacy of your own home. This might be the best way to start practicing, as you can become familiar with the poses and sequences before going to a class. Attending yoga classes at your local community center, gym, or YMCA is also a nice way to introduce yourself to the practice. Classes held in these setting are normally slow, non-heated, and meant for beginners.</p>

<p>Once you’re familiar enough with the basic poses, which will come naturally with time and repetition, you can start to mold your practice to your specific desires. If you’d like to continue practicing outside of a studio setting, I recommend the videos by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/YogaIntervals19">Ali Kamenova</a>, which are all found on YouTube. She has tons of videos, which extend through all levels of difficulty. Her longer videos, about 40-75 minutes, labeled with tags like “abs”, “cardio”, “HIIT”, and “coffee cup” will give you a solid yoga workout. <a href="http://www.gaia.com/article/yoga-at-home?cid=soc:pinterest:MY:articles:al000">This article</a> talks about ways you can further develop your yoga practice at home. Specifically, it discusses tangible methods to help improve the meditative/ mental aspect of your practice. Some studios, like Amazing Yoga in Pittsburgh, even have a <a href="http://www.amazingyoga.net/online-yoga/">library of videos of classes</a> that you can practice along with! For this particular studio access to the library is $15/month, but your first month is free if you’d like to try it out first.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-expect-in-a-studio">What to expect in a studio</h3>

<p>I’ll speak to my experience in Power yoga studios, but most of these tips can apply everywhere.</p>

<h4 id="before-you-go">Before you go</h4>

<p>Before going to a yoga studio, find the studio’s website or give them a call to find out about their schedule and different types of classes. The studio may have only heated or non-heated classes, or may have a mix of both. You should also ask if they have mats to rent or if you’ll need to bring your own mat. Almost all yoga studios have scheduled classes each day, which may be anywhere from 60-90 minutes long. The first time you show up you’ll probably need to fill out a waiver, so it’s best to get there 15-20 minutes before class starts.</p>

<h4 id="what-do-you-wear">What do you wear</h4>

<p>Clothing should be light and not too baggy, so it doesn’t get in the way of any poses. Tight pants like leggings are preferable for the sake of not slipping in certain poses where your arms are pushing against your legs, but shorts are fine and common for men to wear. Yoga is performed barefoot, so don’t worry about footwear. Bringing a towel and water bottle is also recommended.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-you-find-studios">How do you find studios</h4>

<p><a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=yoga+studios+near+me">Let me google that for you.</a>
If there are multiple yoga studios in your area, try a bunch out! Most studios have a new student deal where you get a month or a few weeks for pretty cheap. Normally something in the range of 2 weeks or 30 days for $30. It’s a great steal and normally worth it if you think you’ll go to at least 3  or 4 classes.  While you’re trying out a studio, make sure to attend classes by many different teachers. You may find that there are some teachers you like and some you don’t, which is normal. Teaching styles vary depending on experience level, personality, and yoga style.</p>

<p>Trying out a studio is also nice because you can judge how much you like the other people who practice there. If you might interact with these people on a “hey can you scooch your mat over” basis, you want to know that they’re cool.</p>

<h4 id="prices">Prices</h4>

<p>This might be a make or break reason for practicing privately instead of in a studio. If you have the fortune/ curse of being a student, prices are much better. Most studios offer drop in prices, class passes, and monthly memberships. A drop in price is when you pay for one class at a time. This is very expensive and can range from $15-$25 per class. A class pass is when you pay for a set of classes at a time, and the price per class should reduce to between $10-$15. A monthly membership gives an unlimited number of classes each month and is normally around $100. For students, these prices tend to decrease about 25%.</p>
