<h3 id="a-snack-should-be">A snack should beâ€¦</h3>

<p>When 3pm hits and your motivation slowly fades, a little bit of sugar can go a long way. Sure, I like Oreos as much as the next person, but it feels way better to eat something more filling and less processed. Thatâ€™s why I substitute the afternoon package of cookies with real food: like homemade granola, snack bars, or trail mix.</p>

<p>A snack should be satisfying, moderately healthy, and above all made of tasty, real food.</p>

<h3 id="the-inspiration">The inspiration</h3>

<p>These apricot bars are a recent creation for me. The flavor idea is based off the apricot chocolate flavor of <a href="http://bruksbars.com/">brÃ¼kâ€™s bars</a>. BrÃ¼kâ€™s bars are sold at my yoga studio; I definitely recommend trying them if thereâ€™s a distributor near you. But on the typical PhD stipend, theyâ€™re really too expensive to buy often and even the ingredients are too expensive to recreate exactly.</p>

<p>The version of these apricot bars that Iâ€™ve created are great. Theyâ€™re very few ingredients, and you can basically modify them however you want. If you donâ€™t like coconut, chocolate, or nuts, leave it out. If youâ€™d rather try to substitute in other things, go for it. With the apricot, date, and oat base, the bar will hold itself together just fine, and be agreeable with whatever type of add-ins youâ€™d like the try. I do recommend adding in more oats if you plan to leave out the nuts though.</p>

<h3 id="youll-need">Youâ€™ll need</h3>

<p>â€“ 1 1/2 cups of dried apricots</p>

<p>â€“ 1 packed 1/2 cup of pitted dates (approximately 8 dates)</p>

<p>â€“ 1/2 cup of quick cook rolled oats</p>

<p>â€“ 1/4 cup of hot water</p>

<p>â€“ 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract</p>

<p>â€“ 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon</p>

<p><strong>add-ins I used</strong></p>

<p>â€“ &gt;2 oz of chocolate (I used dark chocolate)</p>

<p>â€“ 1/4 cup of shredded sweetened coconut</p>

<p>â€“ 1/4-1/3 cup of crushed almonds</p>

<h3 id="to-do">To do</h3>

<p>Preheat oven to 350<script type="math/tex">^{\circ}</script>F, 165<script type="math/tex">^{\circ}</script> C. Grease an 8X8 pan, or bread loaf pan. Line with parchment paper (if youâ€™ve got it, itâ€™s not essential) and grease again.</p>

<p>Finely chop up dates and apricots, or use a food processor. Add chopped up date and apricot mixture to a bowl and combine with cinnamon, vanilla, salt, oats, and coconut. If the mixture gets difficult to combine, add a small amount of hot water as needed.</p>

<p>Combine in other desired add-ins.</p>

<p>Press into prepared pan. Bake for 15 minutes. (Baking these bars makes sure the oats arenâ€™t too tough). Freeze overnight or for &gt;2 hours (This helps the bars keep theyâ€™re shape well).</p>

<hr />

<p>Store in an air tight container for up to 5 days or so. Storing them in the fridge helps them keep their shape. Theyâ€™ll keep in the freezer for up to a few weeks.</p>

<p>You could add about twice the amount of oats to make these more like granola bars. Enjoy!</p>
