<p>If you forget how to play the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim">nim</a>, or forget what its winning strategy is, check out my post <a href="/posts/2016/03/09/games-intro.html">Nim - A surprisingly important game</a>. In that same post, there‚Äôs also a bunch of definitions that will help refresh your memory on some properties of combinatorial games, if you need it.</p>

<p>Are you cool with how nim works and remember what combinatorial games are? Good.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>The overall goal of this post is to prove that every impartial game is equivalent to a game of nim. While this result is often called ‚Äúthe Sprague-Grundy theorem‚Äù, the theorem doesn‚Äôt actually say anything about this conclusion.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll define some functions and definitions relevant for the Sprague-Grundy theorem. While none of this material will be particularly difficult, it may be new to you if you haven‚Äôt studied combinatorial games or graph theory before. After proving the theorem, I‚Äôll explain why a game‚Äôs equivalence to nim immediately follows.</p>

<h4 id="mex">Mex</h4>

<p>Let‚Äôs start by defining a function on sets of nonnegative integers called the <strong>minimum excludent (mex)</strong>. Let <script type="math/tex">N</script> be a set of numbers, and</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align*}
  \text{mex}(N) &= \min \{ x \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}: x \not \in N \} \\
    &=\text{the smallest nonnegative integer that is not an element in }N.
\end{align*} %]]></script>

<p>Here are a few examples to help illustrate how the function acts:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align*}
  &\text{mex}(\{0,1,3,7\}) = 2 \\
  &\text{mex}(\{3,0,1,8,4,66,2\}) = 5\\
  &\text{mex}(\emptyset) =0
\end{align*} %]]></script>

<h4 id="games-as-graphs">Games as graphs</h4>

<p>There are multiple ways of setting up an impartial game to explain the Sprague-Grundy theorem, but I like graphs, so I‚Äôm going to make a graph.</p>

<p>A game can be represented as a graph when the vertex set is the set of positions in the game, and there exists a directed edge between vertices <script type="math/tex">x</script> and <script type="math/tex">y</script> if a player can move from position <script type="math/tex">x</script> to <script type="math/tex">y</script>. In normal play, the loser of a game is the person who ends at a vertex which has no out edges. So given a game <script type="math/tex">X=(V,f)</script> there is a position set <script type="math/tex">V</script> and function <script type="math/tex">f</script>, where for each <script type="math/tex">v \in V</script>, <script type="math/tex">f(v)</script> is the possible positions to move to from <script type="math/tex">v</script>. <script type="math/tex">f(v)</script> is the set of <strong>followers</strong> of <script type="math/tex">v</script>. The image below may help illustrate how some positions in a game can be represented as a graph.</p>

<p><img src="\assets\TTTgraph2.png" alt="TTTgraph2" /></p>

<p>On a game <script type="math/tex">X=(V,f)</script>, the <strong>Sprague-Grundy function</strong> is defined as <script type="math/tex">g : V \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}</script>, where</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{align*}
 g(v)=\text{min}\{j \geq 0 : j \neq g(x) \text{ for } x \in f(v) \} = \text{mex}\{ g(x): \text{ for } x \in f(v)\}.
 \end{align*}</script>

<p>So the Sprague-Grundy function inputs a position <script type="math/tex">v</script> and looks at the set of Sprague-Grundy values of <script type="math/tex">v</script>‚Äôs followers. The function returns the smallest nonnegative integer which is not in the set of Sprague-Grundy values of <script type="math/tex">v</script>‚Äôs followers.</p>

<h4 id="combining-games">Combining games</h4>

<p>Looking at a big game where there are tons of positions available is difficult. To overcome this, the big game can be broken into a bunch of smaller games. Analyzing the smaller games, and then combining them back together, is much easier.</p>

<p>Denote the <script type="math/tex">k</script> smaller games as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{align*}
G_1=(V_1,f_1), G_2=(V_2,f_2), \cdots, G_{k}=(V_{k},f_{k}).
\end{align*}</script>

<p>The big game is called the <strong>disjuctive sum</strong> or <strong>combined game</strong> of the <script type="math/tex">k</script> smaller games. Let the big game be denoted as <script type="math/tex">G</script>, and define it as:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align*}
G&=G_1+G_2+ \cdots + G_k=(V,F),\\
& \text{ where, } V= V_1 \times V_2 \times \cdots \times V_k \text{ and } f=f_1 \times f_2 \times \cdots \times f_k.
\end{align*} %]]></script>

<p>(The notation above is traditional for graph theory, but just think of it like an ordered <script type="math/tex">k</script>-tuple if it‚Äôs unfamiliar to you.) So on a player‚Äôs turn, they pick one of the smaller games, <script type="math/tex">G_i</script>, and move in <script type="math/tex">V_i</script> according to <script type="math/tex">f_i</script>.</p>

<p>In the combined game, <script type="math/tex">u=(u_1, \cdots, u_k) \in V</script> is a follower of <script type="math/tex">v = (v_1, \cdots, v_k) \in V</script> exactly when there is some <script type="math/tex">i^* \in [k]</script> such that <script type="math/tex">f_{i^*}(v_{^*i})=u_{i^*}</script> and for all <script type="math/tex">i \in [k]</script> such that <script type="math/tex">i \neq i^*</script>, <script type="math/tex">v_i=u_i</script>. A vertex is a follower in the combined game if it represents a move that could be made in only one of the smaller games.</p>

<h4 id="equivalent-positions">Equivalent positions</h4>

<p>As stated in the beginning of this post, the whole objective here is to prove that two games are equivalent. So let‚Äôs define the notion of equivalent positions in games. Let <script type="math/tex">x</script> and <script type="math/tex">y</script> be two positions, not necessarily in the same game. In <a href="/posts/2016/03/09/games-intro.html">my post on nim</a>, it‚Äôs stated that positions in impartial games are either N or P positions. Let this be referred to as the <strong>outcome</strong> of a position. <script type="math/tex">x</script> and <script type="math/tex">y</script> are said to be <strong>equivalent</strong> if for any position <script type="math/tex">z</script> in any game, the combined positions <script type="math/tex">x+z</script> and <script type="math/tex">y+z</script> have the same outcome.</p>

<p>Intuitively, this means that playing a game from position <script type="math/tex">x</script>, always has the same outcome as playing a game from position <script type="math/tex">y</script>. The outcome of a determined game is only dependent on its starting position. Thus fixed games <script type="math/tex">G</script>, with starting position <script type="math/tex">x</script>, and <script type="math/tex">H</script>, with starting position <script type="math/tex">y</script>, are equivalent if and only if <script type="math/tex">x</script> and <script type="math/tex">y</script> are equivalent.</p>

<h3 id="the-sprague-grundy-theorem">The Sprague-Grundy theorem</h3>

<p>Using the same notation as above, denote the <script type="math/tex">k</script> smaller games as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{align*}
 G_1=(V_1,f_1), G_2=(V_2,f_2), \cdots, G_{k}=(V_{k},f_{k}),
\end{align*}</script>

<p>where game <script type="math/tex">G_i</script> has Sprague-Grundy function <script type="math/tex">g_i</script>. Furthermore, let <script type="math/tex">G</script> be the combined game on the <script type="math/tex">k</script> smaller games, and define function <script type="math/tex">g : V \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}</script> such that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{align*}
g(v_1, v_2, \cdots, v_k) = g_{1}(v_1) \oplus g_{2}(v_2) \oplus \cdots \oplus g_{k}(v_{k}).
\end{align*}</script>

<p>The proof of the Sprague-Grundy theorem will show that <script type="math/tex">g</script> is the Sprague-Grundy function for the combined game. This was the result that was independently proven by Roland Sprague and Patrick Grundy in the mid-late 1930s. Grundy‚Äôs proof was published in Cambridge University‚Äôs Mathematical Society‚Äôs magazine, <em>Eureka</em> in 1939, but Sprague‚Äôs proof was published earlier in 1935.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong> Every impartial game is equivalent to a game of nim played on a certain pile size.</p>

<p>Remember that the Sprague-Grundy function returns the mex of a set. To prove the mex of a set is equal to some value <script type="math/tex">\omega</script>, it must be shown that <script type="math/tex">\omega</script> is not in the set, and any nonnegative integer less than <script type="math/tex">\omega</script> is in the set. For our purposes, let <script type="math/tex">\omega=g_{1}(v_1) \oplus g_{2}(v_2) \oplus \cdots \oplus g_{k}(v_{k})</script>. For arbitrary <script type="math/tex">(v_1,v_2, \cdots, v_{k}) \in V</script>,</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>no follower of <script type="math/tex">(v_1,v_2, \cdots, v_{k})</script> has a Sprague-Grundy value of <script type="math/tex">\omega</script></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>for every nonnegative integer <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\gamma < \omega %]]></script>, there exists a follower of <script type="math/tex">(v_1,v_2, \cdots, v_{k})</script> which has a Sprague-Grundy value of <script type="math/tex">\gamma</script></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="proof">Proof</h4>

<p><strong>Proof for 1.</strong></p>

<p>Assume for sake of contradiction that there was some follower, call it <script type="math/tex">x</script>, of <script type="math/tex">(v_1,v_2, \cdots, v_{k})</script> which had a Sprague-Grundy value of <script type="math/tex">\omega</script>. Checking back at the definition for a follower in the combined game, if <script type="math/tex">x</script> is a follower from <script type="math/tex">(v_1,v_2, \cdots, v_{k})</script>, then <script type="math/tex">x</script> differs from <script type="math/tex">(v_1,v_2, \cdots, v_{k})</script> in exactly one position in the <script type="math/tex">k</script>-tuple. Denote it‚Äôs different position at index <script type="math/tex">j</script> with value <script type="math/tex">v_j'</script>, so <script type="math/tex">x=(v_1,\cdots, v_{j}^{'}, \cdots, v_{k})</script>.</p>

<p>By our assumptions of the existence of the follower and the definition of <script type="math/tex">\omega</script>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align*}
g(x)=g( v_1,\cdots, v^{'}_{j}, \cdots, v_{k})=&g_{1}(v_1) \oplus \cdots \oplus g_{j}(v^{'}_{j}) \oplus  \cdots \oplus g_{k}(v_{k})\\
g(x)= \omega = &g_{1}(v_1) \oplus \cdots \oplus g_{j}(v_{j}) \oplus \cdots \oplus g_{k}(v_{k})\\
\Longrightarrow \quad
g_{1}(v_1) \oplus \cdots \oplus g_{j}(v_{j}) \oplus \cdots \oplus g_{k}(v_{k}) = &g_{1}(v_1) \oplus \cdots \oplus g_{j}(v^{'}_{j}) \oplus  \cdots \oplus g_{k}(v_{k})\\
\Longrightarrow \quad
g_j(v_j) =& g_{j}(v^{'}_{j})
\end{align*} %]]></script>

<p><script type="math/tex">v_j'</script> was a follower of <script type="math/tex">v_j</script> in the smaller game <script type="math/tex">G_j</script>. Thus <script type="math/tex">g_j(v_j) = g_{j}(v^{'}_{j})</script> is a contradiction because by the definition of the minimum excludent, a position cannot have the same Sprague-Grundy value as one of its followers.</p>

<p><strong>Proof for 2.</strong></p>

<p>Let nonnegative integer <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\gamma < \omega %]]></script> be arbitrary and fixed. Consider the binary representations of <script type="math/tex">\gamma</script> and <script type="math/tex">\omega</script>. As <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\gamma<\omega %]]></script>, let <script type="math/tex">k</script> be the leftmost bit so <script type="math/tex">\omega</script> has a 1 at the <script type="math/tex">k^{th}</script> bit and <script type="math/tex">\gamma</script> has a 0 at the <script type="math/tex">k^{th}</script> bit. Since <script type="math/tex">\omega=g_{1}(v_1) \oplus g_{2}(v_2) \oplus \cdots \oplus g_{k}(v_{k})</script>, there is some <script type="math/tex">g_j(v_j)</script> which has a 1 at its <script type="math/tex">k^{th}</script> bit.</p>

<p>Note that <script type="math/tex">\gamma \oplus \omega</script> has a 1 in its <script type="math/tex">k^{th}</script> bit, and has 0s in all bits to the left of the <script type="math/tex">k^{th}</script> bit. Thus <script type="math/tex">\gamma \oplus \omega \oplus g_j(v_j)</script> has a 0 in the <script type="math/tex">k^{th}</script> bit and all bits to the left of the <script type="math/tex">k^{th}</script> bit, so <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\gamma \oplus \omega \oplus g_j(v_j)< g_j(v_j) %]]></script>. Zoom into the small game <script type="math/tex">G_j</script> and see that by the definition of <script type="math/tex">g_j</script>, there exists some follower of <script type="math/tex">v_j</script>, call it <script type="math/tex">v_j'</script>, which has <script type="math/tex">g_j(v_j') =\gamma \oplus \omega \oplus g_j(v_j)</script>. Expanding our view back out to the combined game, the move from <script type="math/tex">(v_1, \cdots, v_j, \cdots, v_k)</script> to  <script type="math/tex">(v_1, \cdots, v_j', \cdots, v_k)</script> is allowed in the game. Lastly, check the Sprague-Grundy value of this follower:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{align*}
g(v_1, \cdots, v_j', \cdots, v_k) &= g_1(v_1) \oplus \cdots g_j(v_j') \oplus \cdots g_k(v_k)\\
 &= \gamma \oplus \omega \oplus g_1(v_1) \oplus \cdots g_j(v_j) \oplus \cdots g_k(v_k)\\
 &= \gamma \oplus \omega \oplus \omega = \gamma
\end{align*} %]]></script>

<p>So there exists a follower of <script type="math/tex">(v_1,v_2, \cdots, v_{k})</script> which has a Sprague-Grundy value of <script type="math/tex">\gamma</script>.</p>

<h3 id="wait-why-does-this-matter">Wait. Why does this matter</h3>

<p>There‚Äôs no mention of nim or equivalence in the proof at all. Sprague and Grundy never actually stated the result of equivalence to nim, but it follows immediately from their proof. It was a few other guys, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">Conway</a>, who made this connection.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll summarize the facts needed from this post and <a href="/posts/2016/03/09/games-intro.html">my post on nim</a> to see how every impartial game is equivalent to a game of nim played on a certain pile size.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A single nim pile of size <script type="math/tex">n</script> has Sprague-Grundy value  <script type="math/tex">n</script>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A position is a P-position if and only if its Sprague-Grundy value is 0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Sprague-Grundy value of the combined game on a set of positions is the nim-sum of the positions‚Äô Sprague-Grundy values.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Let position <script type="math/tex">x</script> in a game have Sprague-Grundy value <script type="math/tex">n</script>, and denote <script type="math/tex">*n</script> as a game of nim on a single pile of size <script type="math/tex">n</script>. By fact 1, the Sprague-Grundy values of <script type="math/tex">x</script> and <script type="math/tex">*n</script> are the same. Then by fact 3, for any position <script type="math/tex">z</script>, the Sprague-Grundy values of <script type="math/tex">x+z</script> and <script type="math/tex">*n+z</script> are the same. Thus <script type="math/tex">x+z</script> and <script type="math/tex">*n+z</script> always have the same outcome by fact 2, which means that they are equivalent. So a starting position of a game is equivalent to nim on a single pile of size equal to the Sprague-Grundy value of a starting position of the game. One common way to say this is that a game <script type="math/tex">G</script> with starting position <script type="math/tex">x</script> is equivalent to the <strong>nimber</strong> <script type="math/tex">n</script>, where <script type="math/tex">n</script> is the Sprague-Grundy value of <script type="math/tex">x</script>.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs conclude with noting that using the Sprague-Grundy theorem can be used to analyze a game which consists of a bunch of games. The Sprague-Grundy theorem proves that the Sprague-Grundy function for a combined game is the nim-sum of the Sprague-Grundy values of the component games, where the component games are equivalent to nim on a single pile of size equal to the component game‚Äôs Sprague-Grundy value. For instance, suppose you challenge a friend to simultaneously play nim on piles of size 3, 8, and 13, the game  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim#The_subtraction_game_S.281.2C_2.2C_._._..2C_k.29">21</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprouts_(game)">sprouts</a> on 9 initial dots. Now you have the tools to decide whether or not you want to be the first or second player to beat your friend.</p>
