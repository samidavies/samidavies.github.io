* I love to climb. The past 2 years, I've been [focusing](assets/IMG_3591.mov) on [bouldering](assets/IMG_3511.mov) and have found such a great community within it.

* I'm vegan. I love to bake, cook, and drink matcha lattes.

* In a prior life, I ran a lot. I still run sometimes with my menace of a [dog](assets/banjo.PNG). At UW, I made a lot of friends and ran a lot with [Race Condition Running](http://raceconditionrunning.com).

* I completed my 200 RYT in the summer of 2019. 
I taught [yoga classes at UW](https://www.washington.edu/ima/classes/mindfulness/) for a year or so.
