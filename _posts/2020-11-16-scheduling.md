So far, my work in scheduling has been in designing approximation algorithms for 
scheduling with precedence and communication delay constraints. Very little was known about this setting before our work and some [concurrent work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10776.pdf). We make progress toward one of the top-10 open problem in scheduling theory: do there exist constant factor approximation algorithms in this setting?
