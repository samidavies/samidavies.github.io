Finished two papers in the past couple of months that are available now! 
The first uses learned predictions to improve the run-time of [Ford-Fulkerson methods](\assets/LA_max_flow-arxiv.pdf), both theoretically and empirically.
The second is a totally combinatorial, fast approach for min max [correlation clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13079) (the previous approaches were all LP/ SDP rounding algorithms, which are were slow given the size of the relaxations).
