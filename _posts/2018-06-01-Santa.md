Finding perfect matchings in bipartite hypergraphs is, in general, NP-hard.
However, when the edges of a hypergraph satisfy certain expansion conditions, 
it becomes possible to study the problem algorithmically.
I'm interested in studying these sufficient conditions, 
specifically as they relate to allocation problems.
