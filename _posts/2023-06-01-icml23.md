Two papers accepted to this year's ICML! One is on [learning-augmented Ford-Fulkerson](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.00837.pdf), 
where we use learned predictions to improve the run-time of Ford-Fulkerson methods, both theoretically and empirically.
The other is on a combinatorial, fast algorithm for [Min Max Correlation Clustering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13079.pdf).
