<!-- * I was the secretary for UW's chapter of [AWM](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~awmsc/) during the 2018-2019 academic year. We host events to help create a supportive and inclusive environment for women and underrepresented minorities in mathematics (WUMiM). -->

* I co-taught the course Math in Society to an amazing groups of people during the Summer of 2018 through [FEPPS](http://fepps.org). FEPPS provides college education for incarcerated women, trans-identifying, and gender nonconforming people in Washington. I have tutored and done other work through FEPPS, as well.
