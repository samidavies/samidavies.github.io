* I was a mentor with the [Washington Directed Reading Program](https://sites.uw.edu/wdrp/) during the Spring 2019 quarter. 

* I was the secretary for UW's chapter of [AWM](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~awmsc/) during the 2018-2019 academic year. We host events to help create a supportive and inclusive environment for women and underrepresented minorities in mathematics (WUMiM).

* I taught incarcerated women math through [FEPPS](http://fepps.org). 

* I volunteered at UW's [Math Circles](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~mathcircle/circle/) during the Spring of 2018.
