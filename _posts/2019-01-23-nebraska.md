This weekend I'll be in Nebraska (for the first time) for the [Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate
Women in Mathematics](https://www.math.unl.edu/~ncuwm/21stAnnual/). 
I'm happy to be attending this event as an invited graduate student, as several of
my friends in grad school benefitted from it as undergraduates!
