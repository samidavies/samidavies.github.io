Finished a couple of papers in the next couple months that are available now! 
The first uses learned predictions to improve the run-time of Ford-Fulkerson methods, both theoretically and empirically.
The second is a totally combinatorial, fast approach for min max [correlation clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13079) (the previous approaches were all LP/ SDP rounding algorithms, which are very slow).
